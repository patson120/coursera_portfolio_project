        Hi, I'm Patrick KENNE! <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f44b.png" width="60px" />
      </h1>
      <p>
        As an experienced fullstack developer,
        I'm able to design and develop websites and
        applications from A to Z, using a variety of
        programming languages such as HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, NodeJS, Java and Python.
        I'm also able to work collaboratively with design
        teams to ensure an optimal user experience.
        In addition to my technical skills,
        I have good listening and collaboration skills,
        which are essential for success in this profession.
        As a fullstack developer, I'm able to work in different
        types of companies, such as web agencies, pureplayers,
        SMEs and CIOs within large groups.
        Fullstack developers are highly sought-after,
        especially in startups where versatility is
        appreciated. The best, most experienced profiles
        are the rarest, and some take advantage of their
        expertise to go freelance.
